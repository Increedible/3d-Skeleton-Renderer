# 3d-Skeleton-Renderer
Use of the turtle module to render a 3d-object using vertices and edges.

Use:

Define for each vertice (index 0, 1, 2 ...) it's x, y and z coordinate in the arrays.
Use the edges array to connect the vertices by index.

The program will render the rest! It will spin it around the Y-axis.

Note: You'll need to generate the vertices and edges yourself, In this example an truncated Icosahedron, taken from "Cartesian Coordinates" at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron#Construction
